# How to read a resistor ?

## Orientation
If a golden or silver stripe is found, it should be on the right. Otherwise, the largest stripe should be on the right.

The stripes are then read from left to right.

## Stripes

A resistor has 4 to 6 stripes, which are :

1. first digit
2. Second digit
3. Third digit (_Not used on 4-stripes resistors_)
4. Multiplier
5. Tolerance
6. Temperature coefficient (TCR) (_Available only on 6-stripes resistors_)

## Colors
